<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime, i liked it. MY fav oriteactor in the film was a guy called
    Asta and his friend that was called Huno. I liked thier rivality and their determination
</p>
<h3>Food Wars</h3>
<p>What i prefered the most in this anime was the level of rivalitiy
    between each student in the school and their performance.<br />
    I also liked the way the actor was determine to achive his goal.
